24300863.0	NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Thanks for your comments to the scoring system. It was, if you can see, for the first 2 rounds, the first person who gets the correct answer received a times-infinity bonus because all others are given 0 points. My work with the current scoring system is to encourage people to KEEP ANSWERING after somebody has got correct, and as the same time KEEP the privilege of the first correct-getter. As you can see, owing to this new scoring system, the amount of answer-scripts have risen dramatically. I wonder if the 1-extra-point system will bring any negative effect to the future competitions. It is because each question carries different amount of points, and the first-answer will lose his or her advantage. Instead, I suggest that a multiplier is to be kept instead of replacing it with an addition.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Also, to encourage more replies, I've also given bonus multipliers to the second and third persons who get the correct answer. So what I think after hearing your opinion is, to keep the multiplying system, but the multiplier may be reduced from *4, *2, *1.5 to something like *2, *1.5, *1.2 (something greater than 1 but not greater than 1.5). Hope to see your feedback at my talk page (click the capital letter C in my signature will do ^_^)  	2005	True	user	random	test

Anyway, I believe it very superfulous to have a heading labeled plot + a spoiler tag. It seems very redundant, as most people who read that it's the plot, will take it to mean that it contains the whole plot, details, endings and all. As for Joe Schmoe talking in the coffe shop with x and y in town z being what the show is about, that information belongs in a plot introduction, which generally comes before the plot, without any heading.

I don't understand why you have been going around giving people strict instructions on what to write and what not to write.  For the Aamir Khan and Vidya Balan pages, you insist on not having links to fansites.  I don't understand why.  If you want the power of an administrator, become an administrator.  Don't take the law into your own hands.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Administrators are not the law. Admins are normal users with more abilities. See here: []NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Fan sites are a big problem. First of all, most of them violate copyright laws by displaying pictures which don't have proper copyright information and strictly, those pages are not allowed to display them. If anther page (like Wikipedia) links them, Wiki can get into trouble and with it the entire project. Also, if you add one fansite, you have to add them all. Wiki is no linkfarm and not there to improve people's traffic. Add content instead of links.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegarding the Meera Jasmine page, you are exceptionally rigid about what belongs in the page and what does not.  You want a citation for everything, and you claim that a lot of the information is not relevant on the page.  Do you want us to say ``Meera Jasmine is an Indian actress``, immediately put up a citation, scan a copy of her birth certificate and put it up there just to prove that she exists?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I don't doubt she's an actress. Google has various entries on her to prove that. If someone claims she's a devotee of Ganesha, movie xyz has been a mega-super successful film, it would be nice to add citations so you can identify such claims as not merely fangush or rumour which is very common on actor/actress pages. Lots of actor/actress sites don't have references and I admit that's still a big problem.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the Filmography, I don't understand why you say the director and the co-star belongs in the movie's entry and not in Meera Jasmine's entry.  I'm sure you understand that the career of every actor or actress is shaped by the number of big names he/she works with, and it is a reflection of the actor's career.  So the info certainly belongs to the Meera Jasmine entry.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::``Big names`` is a very controversial topic. What's big name? Is a big name still big compared to international directors/actors like Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg? Furthermore there have been problems with citing co-stars and directors to show that actor xyz is ``greater`` than actor abc. If you follow the edit history of actors Ajith and Joseph Vijay, you'll find a good example. In order to stop people and fans from these kind of edit wars, I think it's better to keep filmographies as simple as possible - else, things can easily be mistaken as fangush or hero glorification. Also, most actor/actress pages in the Indian Cinema Project have filmographies with just the roles and the movie - it was universally agreed upon and no one of the participants wanted to change that. If you insist upon changing the way articles at the Project should be written, you can make a formal proposal here: .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd why do you insist on creating links to pages that do not exist, such as the movie pages which do not exist?  If you insist on creating a link, you make sure the link points to something, and if a page does not exist, create the page first before pointing to it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::If you have a red link (one without an article behind it), people easily identify it as such and are generally more easily motivated to click on that link and create the article if they have seen the movies.

In fact, while checking my article history log later, i discovered that my mentioned article was not only much visited & edited afterwards but was even vandalised twice anonymously by 121.6.121.182 & 75.5.10.233 (Prhchi?). Fortunately, it was reverted by some kind souls later. i felt sad as this is my first encounter of such incidents to date. Yes, I do like to mention about another recent article i wrote as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Tanjong_Katong. It's about a forgotten British fort that was discovered in Singapore in recent years but was reburied again & its fate till now is uncertain.

This article is not about ``his public life`` alone (which hasn't yet merited a separate article other than Legislation sponsored by Ron Paul), nor about ``his viability as a candidate`` (see Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008). This is a biography and his private life ought to be weighted as fully as reliable sourcing and BLP permit; I have not seen consensus anywhere that anyone's family should be constrained to names and categories and dates. It is also properly placed in the article; where else would it go? Naturally a successful, vibrant 50-year marriage is an exceptional claim, fully sourced of course. No hard feelings, but I will probably revert much of this later under bold, revert, discuss, looking forward to an interesting discussion; I also have another source for additional of this.

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! NEWLINE_TOKENHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?NEWLINE_TOKENWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. NEWLINE_TOKENI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. NEWLINE_TOKENI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter.

I think you mean that only involved using the ``undo`` button. Compare [] and [], with this latter being the last of a series starting here [].

Concerning the approach you suggest, surely this is what I've been trying to do for some months now? You insist on saying that if this is a problem then this must be because there are different opinions about specific facts and sources, but this is not the case at all. Causteau's own explanations to you above make his attitude clear, which is that he'll revert anything he can find a reason to revert and he finds people making lots of edits somehow against Wikipedia policy. If necessary, he'll keep looking for new reasons he can experiment with after others are knocked down, and he is willing to revert before he has his argument together as well, on the basis that people should not be edited until he has had his satisfaction.  `	2008	True	user	random	train

288635842.0	NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==GA Sweeps invitation==NEWLINE_TOKENHello, I hope you are doing well. I am sending you this message since you are a member of the GA WikiProject. I would like to invite you to consider helping with the GA sweeps process. Sweeps helps to ensure that the oldest GAs still meet the criteria, and improve the quality of GAs overall. Unfortunately, last month only two articles were reviewed. This is definitely a low point after our peak at the beginning of the process when 163 articles were reviewed in September 2007. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. All exempt and previously reviewed articles have already been removed from the list. Instead of reviewing by topic, you can consider picking and choosing whichever articles interest you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe are always looking for new members to assist with the remaining articles, so if you are interested or know of anybody that can assist, please visit the GA sweeps page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. If only 14 editors achieve this feat starting now, we would be done with Sweeps! Of course, having more people reviewing less articles would be better for all involved, so please consider asking others to help out. Feel free to stop by and only review a few articles, something's better than nothing! Take a look at the list, and see what articles interest you. Let's work to complete Sweeps so that efforts can be fully focused on the backlog at GAN. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or  and we'll be happy to help. Happy editing!   •  	2009	True	user	random	dev

That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a ``big man``, and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe edits I have made (and will continue to make) on the Jack Straus entry regarding his death doesn't violate policy in ANY way. If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used. You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything poker-related on Wikipedia. You are not, and you will not censor me. And as I'm sure you've already realized, my ISP address constantly changes, so you won’t be able to block me, either.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo piss off. ;)`	2009	False	user	blocked	train

It was a red link on a page I had created and when I read about it, I realized that it had an interesting life and was under appreciated. I have a soft spot for under appreciated thing that are interesting so wanted to improve the article. I've done what I could with my awful Danish to English skills and was in need of help. I think the page is 75% done and just needs a wee bit more love. If you'd like to help I could set up a sandbox for it so we can work on improving the article. When that's done we'd need to get some sources as it only has one right now. Then we'd need to get the information into English. Once it's in English I can do most of the editing. I'd also like to find someone who'd be able to get some photos. Maybe since it's a museum they'd probably even help if we emailed them. So what do you say, are you in ? (  )	2009	True	user	random	dev

It's f**king amoebas like you that have kept this most pathetic excuse for entertainment going for all these years - it should have died when all the redknecks finally found out it wasn't real. How this can still be a viable business in this day and age? But when there's enough 'people' with flea brains so abysmal to sit there editing Wikipedia most minutes of the day, it's no real f**king surprise.	2010	False	user	blocked	train

348232938.0	NEWLINE_TOKEN:: Thanks for your message. I have already spent far too much time on the issue, so that I shall not take any further action. J Milburn's argument is faulty: one cannot remove an image on the possibility of the events that may or may not take place in the future; the relevant question is whether my copyright statement is incorrect at the time being, and the answer to this is clearly in the negative (at least Milburn has not come up with a free image of Michael Foot, thereby showing that my copyright statement were invalid) so that the image must stay. I have argued, but to no avail, that when a free image turns up (there is no a priori reason why a free image should at all become available at any foreseeable time from now), that event renders my present copyright statement invalid, at which instance the present image must be replaced by the available free image. At present no law is violated, so that there is no reason why the image should be removed. But I have said this many times, and unless  takes a firm action, I am afraid that the image will be removed because someone has put his heart into removing it. From the legal perspective, the action by Milburn can be likened with putting an innocent person in prison on the suspicion that that person may break a law in future, which of course is what fascist states do as a matter a course. Milburn has incidentally put his heart into removing the image of Ebrahim Pourdavoud, even though there is no reason for doing so; the image has a perfectly valid copyright statement and there is no reason to believe that the person who has made it public might have unlawfully appropriated it. Above all, Pourdavoud is not a sexy celebrity whose photograph would be worth anything from the commercial perspective (he is also long dead - his daughter was in her eighties when I saw her for the last several years ago, so that there is also no one who would have any interest, commercial or otherwise, in keeping the photograph at issue from public domain).

As such it is a perfectly good page. However, in creating it you have removed the necessary and separate page which disambiguates between uses of the term ``Abdul Halim``, analagous to Rice (disambiguation): Abdul Halim (disambiguation) is currently a redirect to Abdul Halim, which is not a disambiguation page as it does not follow the disambiguation guidelines I referred to above. Also, by placing the name page at Abdul Halim, you give it the status of primary topic. It is more likely that one of the other uses should be there, or it should be the disambiguation page. I suggest you correct your edits to be in line with current guidelines by moving the current Abdul Halim to Abdul Halim (name) and creating a new disambiguation page at Abdul Halim, following the guidelines at WP:D and MOS:D.

I haven't even had much of a chance to read over the other articles listed on Wikipedia that I have researched, because of the issues with this Sante Kimes page. The article began going in a neutral point of view, then you began to change the tone of the article. I don't understand it, other than you have a biased opinion. I posted discussions on the discussions page regarding changes that I thought were needed.NEWLINE_TOKENYou could have simply changed the article to say ``Sante Kimes is a convicted murder`` if the small change I made was that horrible to you. I think the change to the lead you made is just out of spite because I said ``being a con artist is not a crime``. I actually meant it in a joking way, not to criticize you, but you apparently took it as an attack because of what you listed in the edit note in your reply and at around the same time you changed the lead info.  NEWLINE_TOKENHad you posted on the discussion page about his first, I would have talked with you about it. The change I made to the lead was from a neutral POV. I don't know how it was not.NEWLINE_TOKENAs for saying ``American woman`` that is listed for several female criminals in their lead information on Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENAn example is Susan Smith, one I happened to notice before changing the lead on the Sante Kimes article to ``American woman``.

Here's what you need to do; Since Ibazar is already an article (but just a redirect), I recommend creating your article in the user space first before moving it to the main article. That way we can make one clean move to rollout the full article. So create a draft article using the article wizard, carefully noting the mentioned guidelines (good sources, etc), before actually creating the draft. When you're ready, you can optionally submit the article for review, noting on the talk page that this will be moved to an existing, currently redirected, article. Otherwise if you are confident then feel free to copy and paste and replace the redirect page. Let me know if you need any help! —   `	2013	True	user	random	train

572190681.0	`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: , Thank you for your words, most of these Indian theories conceptualized and worded in a very one-sided basis. Conflict of Interest is an absolute commonplace, and staying neutral is possibly the best means to address such issues and bring-about compromise. I'am no religion-buff myself(and I don't think, I'd develop some interest too), so sadly I won't be able to really see through the pages you have mentioned, and be able to assist dialogue. India WAS a spiritual country, where different cultures co-existed and confluenced across South Asia. But that was long before colonization, that threw up new nations on ethnic and religious basis. From that point onwards, things have never been the same, there are suppressed nations every nook and corner, the Balochs in Pakistan, the Kashmiris and the North-Eastern tribes in India, the Hindus of Bangladesh and of course the Tamils of Sri Lanka(something we have dealt with mutually). Its easy to understand your position, but once you realize how India or Sri Lanka does not broadly define a nation and how numerous individual nations and cultures exist within them, then you would see why such an extent of conflict of Interest arises, and maybe then you won't feel so burdened perhaps. So just get over the reluctance, and resume editing soon mate, for you will be amazed by the things you learn and the experience would really leave you enthralled.  .  . mail) `	2013	True	user	blocked	dev

Plus, I do know that most encyclopedias have tons of info so actually wat I did 1 month ago was to revert back edits by Helicopterllama since I think like the necessary details need to be included but now it's not only me who is making a fool out of myself. Others did tried to do the same thing. So all I got to say is since my edits are 'worth' don't remove them it's a perfect article anyone caught doing it will be reverted straight away.

635594898.0	`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Further discussion===NEWLINE_TOKENAn unregistered editor just edited Oregon State University and asserted that it's a flagship university citing only this reference.  It's a reliable source but it's really, really weak evidence for such an important claim.  The paper was released ten years ago and classifies institutions as ``flagships`` based on data that were already over ten years old when the paper was released which means the data are now more than twenty years old.  The document was published as an NBER working paper which means that it may have undergone some sort of review process but it was not published in a peer-reviewed journal or other venue where we are assured of editorial oversight and quality control (although I assume that the NBER has those kinds of mechanisms in place; I just don't know for sure).  This single piece of weak evidence is entirely insufficient to justify such a strong claim.    NEWLINE_TOKEN:Here's an article that references OSU as a flagship university that also passes WP:RS and is far more recent: Source.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::That doesn't explicitly call OSU a flagship though, just that according to the author of the article there are two flagships. For all we know the author could think WOU and EOU are the flagships. Personally, I think OSU shouldn't be listed as flagship  if you do a quick search for UO's flagship status, there are comparatively many many more sources backing that up.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Actually, the The Bulletin article implies that the chancellor of the Oregon University System said that the two institutions are flagships.  But it's not a direct quote so it's not entirely clear if that is something the chancellor said or the reporter's opinion or interpretation.  Without knowing which of those two possibilities is correct, this is pretty weak source, too.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::There have been several discussions and edit wars about the flagship status (or lack thereof) of several universities lately so I apologize if I'm repeating myself but I urge you to consult the sources in Flagship; they're pretty good sources and include many of the most authoritative on this very subjective, murky, and ill-defined topic.  You'll be on much better ground if you can cite sources written by experts in higher education.    `	2014	True	article	random	train

640834028.0	`:::::::::::::No, sorry, you are still very wrong. Impartialness is a factor of WP:NPOV, and we have to be able to distinguish between opinion and fact. Again, there remain very few facts that we can associate with GG overall short of what's in the current History section - it is a war of opinions here, that's why its a controversy.  Further FRINGE states we give fringe views a neutral, fair treatment with the associated weight of ink they get from RS. So because ethics claims have been discussed, if not then debunked by the authors in the next breath, in these highly reliable sources, we can discuss them in a non-prejudging way and then later include the criticism of them; that's how we meet all content policies. End of the day we cannot appear to take a side in the GG issue, and everything you have said above is against that point. And that I'm ``trying to use an avalanche of incredibly negative stories`` to say its about ethics is 100% wrong. I'm trying to introduce the required impartiality into the article per NPOV. I don't necessarily believe at the end of the day GG is about ethics, but they have presented that as their case, and as we are an impartial encyclopedia, we should include any facets of their case that have been appropriately documented in highly reliable sources. Failure to do so is showing a partial view of the story. The fact that these claims are made in negatively-charged stories doesn't matter, they are stated in what everyone here is considering as highly reliable sources; most of what we know about Westboro Baptist Church, for example, comes from highly-negative sources about the congretation, but we still can document what the church claims about itself from them. That's exactly what we must do here.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`	2015	True	article	random	train

I am Piotr Konieczny (), you may know me as an active content creator (see my userpage), but I am also a professional researcher of Wikipedia. Recently I published a paper (downloadable here) on reasons editors participated in Wikipedia's biggest vote to date (January 2012 WP:SOPA). I am now developing a supplementary paper, which analyzes why many editors did not take part in that vote. Which is where you come in ) You are a highly active Wikipedian (15th most active!), and you were active back during the January 2012 discussion/voting for the SOPA, yet you did not chose to participate in said vote. I'd appreciate it if you could tell me why was that so? For your convenience, I prepared a short survey at meta, which should not take more than a minute of your time. I would dearly appreciate you taking this minute; not only as a Wikipedia researcher but as a fellow content creator and concerned member of the community (I believe your answers may help us eventually improve our policies and thus, the project's governance).
